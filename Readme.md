📜 Dynamic Quote Generator Web App
📌 Project Overview

The Dynamic Quote Generator is a simple web application that displays a random meaningful quote along with its author each time a user clicks a button. The project is built using basic web technologies — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — and focuses on understanding how dynamic content works on a webpage.

🎯 Purpose of the Project

The main purpose of this project is to:

Learn how JavaScript can dynamically change content on a webpage

Understand the interaction between HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript logic

Practice using arrays as a small data library

Create a user-friendly and minimal interface

⚙️ How the Project Works

A predefined library of meaningful quotes (with authors) is stored in a JavaScript array.

When the “New Quote” button is pressed, JavaScript randomly selects a quote from the library.

The selected quote and author are displayed instantly without reloading the page.

🧠 Challenges Faced

Some challenges encountered during development include:

Designing a clean and minimal user interface without overusing CSS

Structuring JavaScript code to keep it simple and readable

Randomly selecting quotes without repetition bias

Ensuring the webpage remains responsive and visually balanced
